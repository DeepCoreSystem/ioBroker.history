This adapter saves state history in a two-staged process. 
At first data points are stored in RAM, as soon as they reach maxLength they will be stored on disk.

To set up some data points to be stored they must be configured in admin "Objects" Tab (last button).

## Settings

- **Storage directory** - Path to the directory, where the files will be stored. It can be done relative to "iobroker-data" or absolute, like "/mnt/history" or "D:/History"
- **Maximal number of stored in RAM values** - After this number of values reached in RAM they will be saved on disk.
- **Store origin of value** - If "from" field will be stored too. Can save place on disk.
- **De-bounce interval** - Protection against too often changes of some value. 
- **Storage retention** - How many values in the past will be stored on disk.

## Access values from Javascript adapter
The sotred values can be accessed from Javascript adapter. E.g. with following code you can read the list of events for last hour:

```
// Get 50 last stored events for all IDs
sendTo('history.0', 'getHistory', {
    id: '*',
    options: {
        end:       new Date().getTime(),
        count:     50,
        aggregate: 'onchange'
    }
}, function (result) {
    for (var i = 0; i < result.result.length; i++) {
        console.log(result.result[i].id + ' ' + new Date(result.result[i].ts).toISOString());
    }
});

// Get stored values for "system.adapter.admin.0.memRss" in last hour
var end = new Date().getTime();
sendTo('history.0', 'getHistory', {
    id: 'system.adapter.admin.0.memRss',
    options: {
        start:      end - 3600000,
        end:        end,
        aggregate: 'onchange'
    }
}, function (result) {
    for (var i = 0; i < result.result.length; i++) {
        console.log(result.result[i].id + ' ' + new Date(result.result[i].ts).toISOString());
    }
});
```

Possible options:
- **start** - (optional) time in ms - *new Date().getTime()*'
- **end** - (optional) time in ms - *new Date().getTime()*', by default is (now + 5000 seconds)
- **step** - (optional) used in aggregate (m4, max, min, average, total) step in ms of intervals
- **count** - number of values if aggregate is 'onchange' or number of intervals if other aggregate method. Count will be ignored if step is set.
- **from** - if *from* field should be included in answer
- **ack** - if *ack* field should be included in answer
- **q** - if *q* field should be included in answer
- **addId** - if *id* field should be included in answer
- **limit** - do not return more entries than limit
- **ignoreNull** - if null values should be include (false), replaced by last not null value (true) or replaced with 0 (0)
- **aggregate** - aggregate method:
    - *minmax* - used special algorithm. Splice the whole time range in small intervals and find for every interval max, min, start and end values.
    - *max* - Splice the whole time range in small intervals and find for every interval max value and use it for this interval (nulls will be ignored).
    - *min* - Same as max, but take minimal value.
    - *average* - Same as max, but take average value.
    - *total* - Same as max, but calculate total value.
    - *count* - Same as max, but calculate number of values (nulls will be calculated).
